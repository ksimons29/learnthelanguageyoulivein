## How to Capture Words

### Quick Capture

1. Tap the **coral + button** (bottom of screen)
2. Type your word or phrase
3. Tap **Save**

That's it! LLYLI automatically:
- Translates your word
- Generates native pronunciation audio
- Categorizes it (food, work, social, etc.)

### Capture with Memory Context (Optional)

Want stronger recall? Add context about WHERE and WHEN you learned the word:

1. After typing your word, tap **Add memory context**
2. Add a location: "at the bakery", "in the office"
3. Select situation tags: Nervous, Alone, With Friends, etc.
4. Write a personal note: "First time I ordered coffee!"
5. Tap **Save**

Memory context creates retrieval cues that strengthen recall. When you review the word, you'll see these hints.

### Which Language to Type?

You can type in EITHER language:

- Type **Portuguese** → Get English translation
- Type **English** → Get Portuguese translation

LLYLI detects which language you entered and translates to the other.

## Understanding Mastery

### Mastery Levels

Each word progresses through three stages:

| Level | Meaning | Visual |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Learning** | 0-1 correct sessions | Empty progress bar |
| **Learned** | 2 correct sessions | Partially filled |
| **Ready to Use** | 3+ correct sessions | Full, green |

### The 3-Session Rule

A word isn't "mastered" until you get it right on **3 separate occasions**:

1. Get "stamps" correct on Monday morning → 1/3
2. Get "stamps" correct on Monday evening → 2/3
3. Get "stamps" correct on Tuesday → 3/3 = **Mastered!**

Sessions must be >2 hours apart. This prevents cramming and ensures real retention.

### What Happens After Mastery?

- Mastered words appear less frequently
- Review intervals extend (days → weeks → months)
- If you miss one, the counter resets and you'll practice more

## Understanding the Science

### Why Sentences?

LLYLI practices words in sentences, not isolation, because:
- **Context builds connections:** Your brain links words to situations
- **Varied exposure:** Same word in different contexts = stronger memory
- **Real-world preparation:** You'll use words in sentences, not flashcards

### Why Timed Reviews?

LLYLI uses **FSRS-4.5**, a scientifically-optimized algorithm:
- Reviews scheduled when you're about to forget
- Each correct answer strengthens memory
- Intervals grow: 1 day → 3 days → 1 week → 1 month → etc.

**Result:** 85%+ retention with minimal effort

### Why Memory Context?

Research shows **encoding specificity**: recall improves when context matches.
- "Where was I?" triggers memory retrieval
- "What was happening?" activates related memories
- Personal notes create emotional connections

---

## Tips for Success

### Capture Consistently

- Add 2-3 words per day minimum
- Capture words you actually encounter
- Real-life vocabulary sticks better than textbook words

### Review Daily

- 10-15 minutes is enough
- Same time each day builds habit
- Morning reviews help cement yesterday's captures

### Be Honest with Ratings

- "Again" isn't failure - it's feedback
- Don't rate "Easy" if you hesitated
- Accurate ratings = better scheduling

### Add Context When It's Meaningful

- Not every word needs context
- Add it for words with strong memories
- "At the pharmacy when I was sick" is more memorable than nothing

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No words due" but I have words

- New words become due 1 day after capture
- Check your notebook to see scheduled dates
- Words you just captured need time

### Audio not playing

- Check your device volume
- Try tapping the speaker icon again
- Some words may take a moment to load audio

### Wrong translation

- AI translations are usually accurate but not perfect
- You can edit any word in the Notebook
- Tap the word → Edit → Correct the translation

### Forgot password

1. Go to sign-in page
2. Tap "Forgot password"
3. Enter your email
4. Check for reset link
5. Create new password

## FAQ

### Can I add phrases, not just single words?

Yes! You can capture short phrases like "com licenca" (excuse me) or "muito obrigado" (thank you very much). Keep phrases short - under 5 words works best.

### Can I import words from other apps?

Not yet in the MVP. This feature is planned for a future update.

### Can I practice offline?

Limited offline support via PWA caching. For best experience, use with internet connection.

### Why European Portuguese specifically?

Our primary users are expats living in Portugal who found that other apps teach Brazilian Portuguese. European Portuguese has different vocabulary, spelling, and verb forms (tu vs. você).

### How is this different from Anki?

| Anki | LLYLI |
|------|-------|
| Create your own cards | Auto-generate everything |
| Word pairs | Sentence-based practice |
| 1987 algorithm | 2023 FSRS algorithm |
| Desktop-focused | Mobile-first |
| Manual | Frictionless |

### Is my data private?

Yes. Your words, progress, and personal notes are stored securely and never shared. We don't sell data or show ads.
