## What is LLYLI?

**LLYLI** (Learn the Language You Live In) is a vocabulary retention app designed for people who are immersed in a language they're learning. Unlike traditional language apps that teach generic curriculum vocabulary, LLYLI captures the words *you* encounter in *your* life—from your landlord's texts, cafe menus, work emails, and overheard conversations—and ensures you actually remember them.

**The Core Promise:** Add a word. Learn it forever.

## The Problem We Solve

### User Research Findings (24 survey respondents)

Our research revealed a consistent pattern among language learners living abroad:

| Finding | Frequency | Quote |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Don't write words down** | 75% | "I think I'll remember it but don't write it down" |
| **Save but never review** | 25% | "I save them somewhere but never review" |
| **Can't stay motivated** | 25% | "But without a motivating structure to learn, repeat and apply them it is not doable" |
| **Wrong Portuguese variant** | 15% | "Duolingo doesn't offer EU Portuguese" |
| **Too much work** | 15% | "It's too much work to turn them into good examples or cards" |

**The Pattern:** People encounter useful vocabulary every day, capture it inconsistently (if at all), and have no system to actually retain it. Even when they use flashcard apps, the repetitive content kills motivation within weeks.

### Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Solution | Why It Fails | Research Reference |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Duolingo/Babbel** | Teaches generic curriculum, not YOUR words. Wrong regional variants. | Survey: "no schilpad in early lessons" |
| **Anki/Quizlet** | Requires manual card creation. Same sentence repeated forever. | Research: Only 36% stick with SRS tools beyond month 1 |
| **Notes app** | Captures words but provides no review system | Survey: "I save them somewhere but never review" |
| **Phrasebooks** | Someone else's vocabulary, not yours | Research: Irrelevant curriculum kills engagement |

## How LLYLI Works

### The Three-Step Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        THE LLYLI LOOP                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│   1. CAPTURE          2. REVIEW           3. MASTER             │
│   ─────────           ──────────          ──────────            │
│   Type a word    →    Fresh sentences →   3 correct recalls     │
│   < 2 seconds         10-15 min daily     = Ready to use        │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Capture (2 seconds)

You type a word you encountered. That's it.

- **Auto-detection**: App determines if it's your native language or target language
- **Instant translation**: Translation appears within 1 second
- **Native audio**: Professional TTS generates correct pronunciation
- **Category tagging**: Auto-categorized (Food, Work, Social, etc.)

**Example:** You type "aquecimento" → Translation: "heating" → Audio ready → Saved.

### Step 2: Review (10-15 minutes daily)

The app schedules your words using the FSRS algorithm—a mathematically proven system that calculates exactly when you're about to forget each word.

**The Key Difference:** Every review shows your word in a **fresh, never-repeated sentence** combining it with other vocabulary you're learning:

> "O **aquecimento** do apartamento está com **avaria**."
> (The heating of the apartment has a breakdown.)

This isn't memorizing a flashcard—it's learning to recognize words in varied, realistic contexts.

### Step 3: Master (3-recall rule)

A word is marked "Ready to Use" only after you recall it correctly on **three separate review sessions**.

- Session 1: Recall "aquecimento" correctly ✓
- Session 2: Recall it again, different sentence ✓
- Session 3: Recall it again, different context ✓
- Status: **Ready to Use**

This strict criterion ensures you can actually use the word when your landlord calls, not just recognize it on a flashcard.

## User Onboarding

### The Two-Question Setup

LLYLI's onboarding takes under 30 seconds:

**Screen 1: "What language fills your days?"**
→ Select your target language (e.g., Portuguese Portugal, Dutch, Swedish)

**Screen 2: "And your mother tongue?"**
→ Select your native language (e.g., Dutch, English)

That's it. No account maze. No 47-screen tutorial. You're in.

### Supported Language Directions

| From (Native) | To (Learning) | Status |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| English | Portuguese (Portugal) | ✅ Active |
| Dutch | Portuguese (Portugal) | ✅ Active |
| Dutch | English | ✅ Active |
| English | Swedish | ✅ Active |

**Why EU Portuguese matters:** Multiple survey respondents explicitly mentioned that Duolingo offers Brazilian Portuguese but not European Portuguese. LLYLI enforces pt-PT regional variants with specific pronunciation instructions.

### First Word Experience

After language selection, users capture their first word immediately:

1. Type any word (native or target language)
2. See translation + hear pronunciation
3. Word saved to personal notebook

This ensures users experience the full capture loop before any tutorial content.

## Gamification Features

### Why Gamification?

User research revealed the #1 problem: **staying motivated and consistent**.

> "But without a motivating structure to learn, repeat and apply them it is not doable." — Ralf (Swedish learner)

LLYLI's gamification is designed to be **forgiving, not punitive**. We celebrate progress rather than punishing missed days.

### Daily Goal

**Default target:** 10 word reviews per day

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Today's Progress                   │
│                                        │
│         ████████░░  8/10               │
│                                        │
│     2 more to complete your goal!      │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The daily goal is achievable in 10-15 minutes—designed for busy adults with real jobs.

### Streak System (Forgiving)

LLYLI uses a **forgiving streak system** that includes one free "freeze" per week:

| Day | Activity | Streak |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Mon | Complete goal | 1 |
| Tue | Complete goal | 2 |
| Wed | Miss day | 2 (freeze used) |
| Thu | Complete goal | 3 |
| Fri | Miss day | **Streak resets** |

**Why forgiving?** Research shows punitive streak systems cause anxiety and app abandonment. One free freeze acknowledges that life happens.

### Bingo Board

A 3×3 grid of achievable daily challenges:

| Row 1 | Row 2 | Row 3 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Review 5 words | 3 correct in a row | Complete a fill-blank |
| Complete multiple choice | Type a translation | Review a work word |
| Review a social word | Master a word | Finish daily session |

**Design principles:**
- All squares achievable during normal review session
- Mix of quantity (review 5) and quality (3 in a row)
- Category variety encourages diverse vocabulary capture
- Daily reset prevents "finish early and stop" behavior

### Boss Round

**Unlocks after completing daily goal.** A 90-second speed challenge featuring your 5 most difficult words (highest lapse count in FSRS).

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          🏆 BOSS ROUND                 │
│                                        │
│     5 hardest words · 90 seconds       │
│                                        │
│     ⏱️ 0:47 remaining                   │
│                                        │
│     Score: 4/5                         │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Purpose:**
- Targets exactly the words you struggle with
- Time pressure simulates real conversation recall
- Optional—only for users who want extra challenge
- Celebration screen on completion

## The Science Behind LLYLI

### FSRS Algorithm (Spaced Repetition)

LLYLI uses **FSRS-4.5** (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler), a mathematically proven algorithm that:

1. **Models your forgetting curve** for each individual word
2. **Calculates retrievability** (probability you'll remember)
3. **Schedules reviews** when retrievability drops below 90%

**Why not fixed intervals?**

| Approach | Schedule | Problem |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Fixed intervals | 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days | Doesn't account for word difficulty or your personal memory |
| FSRS | Calculated per word | Easy words space out; difficult words return sooner |

**Key FSRS parameters tracked per word:**
- **Difficulty**: How hard this word is for you
- **Stability**: How long until you forget it
- **Retrievability**: Current probability you'll remember
- **Reps**: Total times you've reviewed it
- **Lapses**: Times you've forgotten it

### Dynamic Sentence Generation

Research shows that **repeated exposure to the same example sentence leads to card memorization, not word learning** (Research Notes Section 2.1.A).

LLYLI generates a **new sentence for every review**:

| Traditional Flashcard | LLYLI Dynamic Sentence |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| "aquecimento = heating" (every time) | "O **aquecimento** do apartamento..." (review 1) |
| | "No inverno, o **aquecimento** é essencial..." (review 2) |
| | "O técnico verificou o **aquecimento** do carro..." (review 3) |

**Benefits:**
- 4-6x faster vocabulary acquisition (Research Notes Section 2.1.A)
- Words combine with other vocabulary you're learning
- Context varies, forcing true word recognition
- Novelty maintains engagement

### 3-Recall Mastery Rule

A word requires **3 correct recalls on separate sessions** to graduate to "Ready to Use" status.

**Why 3?**
- Research shows this improves 7-day retention from 64% to 87%
- Prevents "lucky guess" false positives
- Builds genuine recall confidence
- Matches real-world usage requirements

**What happens after mastery?**
- Word enters "Ready to Use" status
- Still scheduled via FSRS, but with longer intervals
- If you forget it later, counter resets to 0

## Exercise Types

LLYLI uses three exercise types that adapt to your mastery level:

### 1. Multiple Choice (Easiest)

**Used for:** New words, struggling words

```
O técnico vem amanhã verificar a _______.

[ avaria ]  [ aquecimento ]  [ conta ]  [ recibo ]
```

**Cognitive load:** Low (recognition only)

### 2. Fill in the Blank (Medium)

**Used for:** Intermediate mastery

```
O _______ do apartamento está com avaria.
(The heating of the apartment has a breakdown.)

[ aquecimento ]  ← User types this
```

**Cognitive load:** Medium (recall from context)

### 3. Type Translation (Hardest)

**Used for:** Near mastery, final validation

```
heating → [ _______________ ]

User types: aquecimento
```

**Cognitive load:** High (pure recall, no context)

**Progression:** The app automatically selects exercise type based on your FSRS stability for each word.
