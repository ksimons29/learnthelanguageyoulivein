## Describing the additional needs based on research and testing 

1. Repport issue with this word, remove it from the review section. Ensure the feedback button it is clear that here feedback needs to be added. 

2. capture, the memory section is still not intuitive to quickly capture, meaning you need to go back to capture it should be with the memory section opened to be able to captrue the word. 

3. audio often not working maybe better to do on a later stage for the iphone app. 

4. explanation of the app, would an intro video or section help to explain on how the app works, what it does, why it is scienfitically good how you can provide feedback, this is the testing phase. 

5. notifications and nudges based on progress in the app so if you had a streak get a message via whatsapp or an email with the results, if you are behind get a nudge notification. If you are having an appointment or need to go somewhere in your calendar the app will notify you to capture something. 

6. ensure on the notebook page always a word with sentence and its translation of the word and sentence is captured. Meaning allways the target language first with sentence and the native language.
