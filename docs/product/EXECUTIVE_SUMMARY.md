# LLYLI Executive Summary

**One-liner:** LLYLI turns real-life language encounters into lasting vocabulary through AI-powered sentence practice and scientifically-optimized spaced repetition.

---

## The Problem

**75% of language learners save words but never review them.**

People living abroad encounter useful vocabulary daily - at the bakery, in meetings, on signs - but fail to retain it. Traditional flashcard apps require too much effort to create cards, show repetitive content, and use outdated algorithms.

---

## The Solution

LLYLI is a **digital language notebook** that makes vocabulary stick:

| Step | What Happens | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| **Capture** | Type a word, get instant translation + audio | 2 seconds |
| **Practice** | AI creates unique sentences combining your words | 10 min/day |
| **Master** | FSRS algorithm schedules optimal review timing | Automatic |

---

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Dynamic Sentence Generation
Most apps show isolated word pairs. LLYLI combines 2-4 of your words in AI-generated sentences that **never repeat**. Each review is fresh, building real-world recall.

### 2. FSRS-4.5 Algorithm
We use a 2023 machine learning-based spaced repetition system - **36 years more advanced** than the algorithm in most apps. It adapts to your personal forgetting curve.

### 3. Memory Context
Record WHERE and WHEN you learned each phrase. Research shows context-linked memories are stronger - remembering "I learned this at the bakery" improves recall.

### 4. European Portuguese
Unlike apps that teach Brazilian Portuguese, LLYLI enforces European Portuguese (pt-PT) with proper spelling and "tu" forms.

## Target Market

**Primary:** Expats and professionals living in immersion environments
- Learning Portuguese (Portugal), Swedish, or English
- Have tried other apps but found them tedious or inaccurate
- Want to capture vocabulary from daily life, not generic word lists

**Personas:**
- **Sofia:** Dutch designer in Lisbon who thinks "I'll remember" but doesn't
- **Ralf:** Goal-setter who needs structure for "3 words/day, 1000/year"
- **Maria:** Frustrated user who abandoned Duolingo for wrong regional variant

## The Science

### Forgetting Curve
Your memory fades predictably. Review just as you start to forget, and memory strengthens. LLYLI times this precisely.

**64% → 87% retention** after 3 well-timed reviews

### Interleaved Practice
Mixing different words in varied contexts creates stronger neural connections than studying each word in isolation.

**4-6x faster** acquisition from varied contexts

### Mastery Rule
Each word needs **3 consecutive correct sessions** (not same-day) to be considered mastered. This prevents cramming and ensures long-term retention.

---

## Design Philosophy

LLYLI uses a **Moleskine notebook** aesthetic:
- Cream paper backgrounds
- Coral ribbon bookmark (one accent per screen)
- Serif headings, clean typography
- Cards with "binding edge" on left

Every screen feels like a page in a premium journal.
