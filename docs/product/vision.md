# Project Vision: LLYLI

## Vision Statement

LLYLI is a language learning platform that transforms single words into lasting language knowledge. Users capture words through a responsive web app, hear them pronounced by native speakers, and review them in fresh contextual sentences. The app uses proven spaced repetition science to schedule reviews. Every review uses a new sentence, never the same one twice, delivering 4-6x faster vocabulary acquisition than traditional flashcard methods.

## Platform Evolution

**Version 1 (Current Focus):** Responsive web application accessible on mobile and desktop browsers. This enables rapid iteration, instant updates, and cross-platform reach while validating the core learning methodology.

**Version 2:** Native iOS app with platform-specific features (Share Extension for capturing from WhatsApp and iMessage, Home Screen Widgets, offline-first architecture, haptic feedback).

**Version 3:** Native Android app with Material Design and Android-specific integrations.

## The Problem We're Solving

Language learners constantly encounter words they want to remember: on signs, in conversations, from colleagues. Current solutions fail them in predictable ways:

**Flashcard apps** require manual sentence creation and show the same example repeatedly, leading to rote memorization without real comprehension. Users recognize the card, not the word.

**Course-based apps** follow rigid curricula disconnected from the learner's actual environment. The vocabulary taught rarely matches what users need for their specific context.

**Note-taking** captures words but provides no system for retention. Screenshots and lists accumulate, forgotten within days.

Research shows 36% of learners abandon assigned SRS tools (Section 2, Research Notes). The core issue: artificial, repetitive content kills motivation before learning takes hold.

## Our Solution

LLYLI solves this with four integrated innovations:

**1. Effortless Word Capture**
Type a word through the web interface. Auto-detection identifies the language. No friction, no setup, no manual card creation. Works on any device with a browser - phone, tablet, or computer.

**2. High-Quality Native Audio**
Every captured word is immediately converted to high-quality native pronunciation using advanced text-to-speech. Learners hear exactly how native speakers say the word, building pronunciation confidence alongside vocabulary retention.

**3. Dynamic Sentence Generation**
When words come due for review, the app generates novel sentences combining multiple related vocabulary items. Each review presents fresh context, supporting inference and preventing pattern memorization. Research shows this approach yields 4-6x faster learning versus isolated word pairs (Section 2.1.A, Research Notes).

**4. Science-Based Retention**
FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) calculates optimal review timing based on individual recall probability. Words graduate only after 3 correct recalls on separate occasions, improving one-week retention from 64% to 87% (Section 6.1, Research Notes). Immediate feedback on every response reinforces correct patterns.

## Target Users

**Primary:** Adults learning a language in immersive contexts. Expats, international professionals, students abroad. They encounter useful vocabulary daily but lack a system to retain it.

**Characteristics:**
- Tech-comfortable, mobile-first
- Time-constrained, prefer short session
- Motivated by practical use, not academic achievement
- Frustrated by generic curricula that ignore their real-world needs

## Value Proposition

**For learners:** Add a word in seconds through any browser. The app handles everything else: translation, native pronunciation audio, sentence creation, scheduling. Review in short daily sessions on your phone, tablet, or computer. Actually remember what you learn.

**Why LLYLI wins:**
- **Web-first accessibility:** No app store, no downloads, works everywhere instantly
- **High-quality audio:** Native pronunciation for every word (competitors often skip audio or use robotic voices)
- **No manual card creation:** Just type a word (competitors require it)
- **Novel sentences every review:** Fresh context every time (competitors repeat the same examples)
- **Adaptive scheduling:** Based on your forgetting curve (competitors use fixed intervals)
- **Your vocabulary, not theirs:** Words from your life, not a curriculum (competitors dictate what you learn)

**Measurable outcome:** Users retain vocabulary at 87% after one week versus industry-standard 64%.

## Long-Term Vision

**V1.0 (Months 1-6):** Web MVP launch. Nail the core loop: Word capture → audio generation → sentence generation → adaptive review. Prove retention metrics (87% at one week) in real users. Mobile-optimized web interface works seamlessly on phones and desktops.

**V1.1 (Months 7-9):** Web enhancements. Browser extension for desktop capture from any webpage. Keyboard shortcuts for power users. Export/import features. Community word packs.

**V2.0 (Year 2):** Native iOS app. Platform-specific features that web can't match: Share Extension (capture directly from WhatsApp, iMessage, Safari), Home/Lock Screen Widgets, offline-first architecture, haptic feedback, iCloud sync. The web app continues for cross-platform users.

**V2.1 (Year 2):** Native Android app. Material Design, Android Share functionality, Home Screen widgets, voice and camera input.

**V3.0 (Year 3):** Personalization layer. The system learns user interests and vocabulary patterns. Recommends related word packs (monetization lever). Generates sentences that reflect user context and preferences. Voice input across all platforms.

**End state:** LLYLI becomes the bridge between encountering language and owning it. Users stop thinking about memorization because the system handles it invisibly, whether they're on their phone, tablet, computer, or wearable.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Capture must be instant.** Any friction kills adoption. Type a word, done. Works on any device, anywhere.

2. **Audio is essential.** Pronunciation is as important as spelling. Every word gets native-quality audio, period.

3. **Novelty drives engagement.** Never show the same sentence twice. Fresh context on every review.

4. **Science over intuition.** Scheduling, mastery criteria, and session design follow research, not assumptions.

5. **Brevity respects attention.** Sentences stay under 10 words. Sessions stay under 20 minutes. No bloat.

6. **Platform follows purpose.** Start with web for rapid iteration and universal access. Add native apps when platform-specific features truly matter.

7. **The user's vocabulary, not ours.** We don't dictate what to learn. We make what they capture stick.
