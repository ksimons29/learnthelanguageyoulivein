# Project Vision: LLYLI

## Vision Statement

LLYLI is a mobile application that transforms single words into lasting language knowledge. Users capture words through text, voice, or camera. The app generates fresh, contextual sentences combining related vocabulary, then schedules reviews using proven spaced repetition science. Every review uses a new sentence, never the same one twice, delivering 4-6x faster vocabulary acquisition than traditional flashcard methods.

## The Problem We're Solving

Language learners constantly encounter words they want to remember: on signs, in conversations, from colleagues. Current solutions fail them in predictable ways:

**Flashcard apps** require manual sentence creation and show the same example repeatedly, leading to rote memorization without real comprehension. Users recognize the card, not the word.

**Course-based apps** follow rigid curricula disconnected from the learner's actual environment. The vocabulary taught rarely matches what users need for their specific context.

**Note-taking** captures words but provides no system for retention. Screenshots and lists accumulate, forgotten within days.

Research shows 36% of learners abandon assigned SRS tools (Section 2, Research Notes). The core issue: artificial, repetitive content kills motivation before learning takes hold.

## Our Solution

LLYLI solves this with three integrated innovations:

**1. Effortless Word Capture**
Type a word, speak it, or photograph it. Auto-detection identifies the language. No friction, no setup, no manual card creation.

**2. Dynamic Sentence Generation**
When words come due for review, the app generates novel sentences combining multiple related vocabulary items. Each review presents fresh context, supporting inference and preventing pattern memorization. Research shows this approach yields 4-6x faster learning versus isolated word pairs (Section 2.1.A, Research Notes).

**3. Science-Based Retention**
FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) calculates optimal review timing based on individual recall probability. Words graduate only after 3 correct recalls on separate occasions, improving one-week retention from 64% to 87% (Section 6.1, Research Notes). Immediate feedback on every response reinforces correct patterns.

## Target Users

**Primary:** Adults learning a language in immersive contexts. Expats, international professionals, students abroad. They encounter useful vocabulary daily but lack a system to retain it.

**Characteristics:**
- Tech-comfortable, mobile-first
- Time-constrained, prefer short session
- Motivated by practical use, not academic achievement
- Frustrated by generic curricula that ignore their real-world needs

## Value Proposition

**For learners:** Add a word in seconds. The app handles everything else: translation, pronunciation, sentence creation, scheduling. Review in short daily sessions. Actually remember what you learn.

**Why LLYLI wins:**
- No manual card creation (competitors require it)
- Novel sentences every review (competitors repeat the same examples)
- Adaptive scheduling based on your forgetting curve (competitors use fixed intervals)
- Words from your life, not a curriculum (competitors dictate what you learn)

**Measurable outcome:** Users retain vocabulary at 87% after one week versus industry-standard 64%.

## Long-Term Vision

**Year 1:** Nail the core loop. Word capture → sentence generation → adaptive review. Prove retention metrics in real users.

**Year 2:** Personalization layer. The app learns user interests and vocabulary patterns. Recommends related word packs (monetization lever). Generates sentences that reflect user context and preferences.

**Year 3:** Expand input modalities. Real-time conversation capture. Document scanning. Integration with communication tools.

**End state:** LLYLI becomes the bridge between encountering language and owning it. Users stop thinking about memorization because the system handles it invisibly.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Capture must be instant.** Any friction kills adoption. One tap, one word, done.

2. **Novelty drives engagement.** Never show the same sentence twice. Fresh context on every review.

3. **Science over intuition.** Scheduling, mastery criteria, and session design follow research, not assumptions.

4. **Brevity respects attention.** Sentences stay under 10 words. Sessions stay under 20 minutes. No bloat.

5. **The user's vocabulary, not ours.** We don't dictate what to learn. We make what they capture stick.
