# LLYLI Onboarding Script

> A narrative walkthrough for new users discovering how LLYLI transforms everyday words into lasting vocabulary.

---

## Meet Sofia

Sofia moved to Lisbon three months ago. She's a Dutch UX designer working remotely, living in Alfama, and desperately trying to learn Portuguese. She's tried Duolingo (abandoned after two weeks), bought a phrasebook (gathering dust), and has a Notes app full of words she's overheard but can't remember.

This morning, her landlord texted about the "aquecimento" not working. She had to Google it. Again. For the third time this month.

She's tired of forgetting.

---

## Day 1: Discovery

### Scene 1: The First Word

Sofia opens LLYLI on her phone. The app asks two simple questions:

**"What language fills your days?"**
She taps **Portuguese (Portugal)**.

**"And your mother tongue?"**
She taps **Dutch**.

That's it. No account setup maze. No 47-screen tutorial. She's in.

The home screen is clean—a cream-colored notebook page with a simple prompt:

> *"What word did you encounter today?"*

She types: **aquecimento**

In under two seconds:
- The app detects it's Portuguese
- Shows the translation: *"heating"*
- A small speaker icon appears

She taps it. A clear, native Portuguese voice pronounces it perfectly: *"ah-keh-see-MEN-too"*

**That's it.** Word captured. Audio ready. No flashcard to create. No example sentence to write.

She adds two more words from the landlord's text:
- **avaria** → *breakdown*
- **técnico** → *technician*

Three words. Thirty seconds. She puts her phone away and goes back to work.

---

### Scene 2: The Afternoon Review

At 3pm, Sofia gets a gentle reminder. She has words ready to review.

She opens the app. Instead of seeing "aquecimento" on a blank flashcard, she sees:

> *"O _______ do apartamento está com avaria."*
> *(The heating of the apartment has a breakdown.)*

Wait—that's a real sentence. Using TWO of her words together. In context.

She types: **aquecimento**

✓ **Correct!**

The app plays the full sentence aloud. She hears how the words flow together naturally.

Next card:

> *"O técnico vem amanhã verificar a avaria."*
> *(The technician comes tomorrow to check the breakdown.)*

This time it's multiple choice. Four options. She picks **avaria**.

✓ **Correct!**

She rates it "Good"—she knew it, but had to think for a moment.

After 8 minutes, the session ends:

> **Done for today!**
> 3 words reviewed · 100% correct · 1 day streak

## Day 3: The Coffee Shop

### Scene 3: Capturing in the Wild

Sofia is at her favorite café in Graça. The barista asks if she wants her coffee "meia de leite ou com cheirinho?"

She has no idea what "cheirinho" means. She asks. The barista laughs—it means a splash of aguardente (brandy) in your coffee. A very Portuguese thing.

Right there, she opens LLYLI:

**cheirinho** → *a little smell; splash of brandy in coffee*

The app auto-categorizes it under "Food & Dining."

She adds two more from the menu:
- **torrada** → *toast*
- **galão** → *latte (Portuguese style)*

Later, in her review session, she sees:

> *"Quero um galão e uma torrada, por favor."*

She smiles. That's literally what she ordered this morning.

## Day 7: The Mastery Moment

### Scene 4: Words Becoming Yours

Sofia opens her Progress page. A small celebration:

> 🎉 **"aquecimento" is ready to use!**
> You've recalled it correctly 3 times across different sessions.

She thinks back. She's seen "aquecimento" in:
- A sentence about her apartment
- A sentence about winter weather
- A sentence about a broken car heater

Three different contexts. Three correct recalls. Not memorizing a flashcard—actually *knowing* the word.

Her stats show:
- **23 words** captured
- **15 words** in active learning
- **4 words** ready to use
- **87% retention rate**

The "Ready to Use" section lists words she can now confidently use in conversation:
- aquecimento
- cheirinho
- conta (bill)
- troco (change)

## Day 14: The Real Test

### Scene 5: Actually Using It

Sofia's landlord calls. The heating is fixed, but there's paperwork.

"Precisa de assinar o recibo do técnico," he says.

She understands. Every word. **técnico** (technician), **recibo** (receipt), **assinar** (sign).

She captured "recibo" at the pharmacy last week. "Assinar" from her gym contract. LLYLI wove them into her reviews without her having to organize anything.

"Sim, claro. Posso passar às seis?" she responds.

Her landlord pauses. Then: "O seu português está muito melhor!"

*Your Portuguese is much better.*

She grins. It's working.

## The LLYLI Loop

Sofia's daily routine is now simple:

**Morning (2 seconds)**
Encounter a word → Type it → Done

**Afternoon (10-15 minutes)**
Review session → Fresh sentences → Audio practice

**Weekly**
Check progress → Celebrate mastered words → Notice real improvement

No curriculum. No lessons. No guilt about "falling behind."

Just the words from her life, becoming part of her language.

## Your Turn

You're not Sofia. Your words are different. Your context is different.

Maybe you're a British retiree in the Algarve learning to chat with neighbors.
Maybe you're a Brazilian developer in Amsterdam picking up Dutch.
Maybe you're an American student in Porto figuring out bureaucracy.

The words you encounter are yours. LLYLI just makes sure you remember them.

**Open the app. Type a word. Start today.**

## Appendix: Exercise Types

As you progress, exercises adapt to your mastery level:

| Exercise | When Used | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Multiple Choice** | New words, struggling words | Pick "avaria" from 4 options |
| **Fill in the Blank** | Intermediate mastery | Type the missing word in a sentence |
| **Type Translation** | Near mastery | See "heating" → type "aquecimento" |

Easier exercises build recognition. Harder exercises build production. The app adjusts automatically.
