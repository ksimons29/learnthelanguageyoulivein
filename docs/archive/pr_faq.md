## A new app turns single words into lasting vocabulary through AI-generated sentences and science-backed spacing.

A new app delivers 87% vocabulary retention through AI-generated sentences and science-backed spacing.

LLYLI launched today, offering language learners a fundamentally different approach to vocabulary retention. Users type a word they want to learn. The app handles everything else: translation, pronunciation, and scheduling reviews at scientifically optimal intervals. 
The breakthrough: every review presents the word in a fresh, never-repeated sentence, combining it with other vocabulary the user is learning.

Early testing shows users retain 87% of vocabulary after one week, compared to 64% with traditional flashcard methods. More importantly, users report using captured phrases in real conversations within 3-5 days versus 7-14 days with conventional SRS tools.

### The Problem

Millions of adults live and work in countries where they're learning the language. They encounter useful words daily—on signs, in WhatsApp messages, from colleagues, at the supermarket—but have no reliable way to remember them when they need them.

Current solutions fail for predictable reasons:
Flashcard apps require users to manually create cards and write example sentences. Most people don't. Those who do see the same sentence repeatedly until they've memorized the card, not the word. Research shows this artificial repetition impedes real-world recall.
Language courses teach vocabulary someone else chose. The words rarely match what learners actually encounter in their lives. You can finish 50 Duolingo lessons and still freeze when your landlord calls about the heating.

Notes and screenshots capture words but provide no system for retention. They accumulate in Apple Notes, forgotten within days. The words you needed yesterday remain trapped in screenshots you'll never review.
Research shows only 36% of learners stick with assigned vocabulary tools beyond the first month. The problem isn't motivation. It's that repetitive, artificial content kills engagement before learning takes hold. Even motivated learners can't tell if they're ready to use the words when a real situation demands it.

### The Solution

LLYLI eliminates the friction and boredom that cause learners to quit, while delivering measurable proof of readiness.

Capture in seconds. Type any word. The app auto-detects the language and generates translation plus native audio pronunciation. No card creation. No manual work. From encounter to captured: under 2 seconds.
Learn in context, every time. When it's time to review, the app generates a fresh sentence containing your word alongside related vocabulary you're also learning. Every review is new. You learn to recognize the word in varied contexts, not memorize a single example. Research shows this approach delivers 4-6x faster vocabulary acquisition than isolated word pairs.

Remember permanently. The app uses FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler), a mathematically proven algorithm that calculates exactly when you're about to forget each word. Reviews arrive at the optimal moment—not too early, not too late. Words graduate only after you recall them correctly three separate times, improving one-week retention from 64% to 87%.

Know when you're ready. After three correct recalls, the app marks words as "ready to use." No more guessing whether you can actually say it when your landlord calls or your colleague asks a question. You have evidence-backed confidence tied to real-world situations.
The result: faster learning, higher retention, and an experience that stays engaging because it's never repetitive. Most importantly, users report actually using their captured phrases in real conversations within days, not weeks.

### Customer Reaction

"I've tried every flashcard app. I always quit after a few weeks because it gets boring—same sentences over and over. LLYLI is different. The sentences are always new, and I'm actually remembering words I added months ago. More importantly, I used three phrases from last week in an actual conversation with my Portuguese neighbor. That's never happened with Duolingo." — Beta tester, American expat in Lisbon
"I was skeptical about 'AI-generated sentences,' but they're actually more natural than what I used to write myself in Anki. And I'm not spending 20 minutes making cards anymore—I just capture and move on with my day." — Beta tester, Dutch student in Barcelona

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**What is LLYLI?**

A mobile app for vocabulary retention. You add words you encounter in real life. The app generates fresh sentences for each review, schedules them using proven spaced repetition science, and tracks your progress toward genuine mastery.

**Who is it for?**

Adults learning a language in real-world contexts: expats, international professionals, students abroad, digital nomads. Anyone who encounters vocabulary they want to remember but lacks a system to make it stick—and wants to know when they're actually ready to use it.

**How is this different from Anki or other flashcard apps?**

4 differences:

No manual card creation. You add a word; the app creates everything else—translation, example sentence, audio.
Dynamic sentences. Every review shows the word in a new context. Traditional apps repeat the same example, leading to card memorization instead of word mastery.
Smarter scheduling. FSRS algorithm adapts to your individual forgetting curve and word difficulty. Fixed intervals (1 day, 3 days, 7 days) don't account for how your memory actually works.
Proof of readiness. Three-correct-recall rule gives you evidence-backed confidence that you can use the word when you need it, not just hope.

**How is this different from Duolingo?**

Duolingo teaches vocabulary someone else selected in a fixed curriculum. LLYLI teaches the words you capture from your own life. You control what you learn.

### Product

**How do I add words?**

Type the word in the app. Works in either your native language or the language you're learning. The app auto-detects which and handles translation.

**Can I add phrases or sentences?**

Type the word in the app. Works in either your native language or the language you're learning. The app auto-detects which and handles translation. Capture takes under 2 seconds.

**What happens during a review session?**

The app shows sentences containing words due for review. You identify or translate the target word. You get immediate feedback. Sessions typically take 10-20 minutes.

**How does the app decide when to review a word?**

FSRS algorithm calculates the probability you'll remember each word. When that probability drops below 90%, the word appears in your next review. This means difficult words come back sooner; easy words space out longer.

**What does "3 correct recalls" mean?**

A word is considered mastered only after you recall it correctly on three separate review sessions. Research shows this improves one-week retention from 64% to 87%. Until you hit three, the word stays in active rotation with shorter intervals.
After three correct recalls, the word is marked "ready to use"—meaning you have evidence-backed confidence you can say it cold when you need it.

**What if I get a word wrong?**

The app shows the correct answer immediately and schedules the word for sooner review. Your mastery counter resets to zero, so you'll need three fresh correct recalls before the word is marked ready.

This might feel strict, but it's the difference between recognizing a word on a flashcard and actually being able to use it when your landlord calls.

**How is this different from Duolingo?

Duolingo teaches vocabulary someone else selected in a fixed curriculum. LLYLI teaches the words you capture from your own life. You learn "fazer filas" because you waited in line at SEF yesterday, not because lesson 47 says so.
You control what you learn. The app controls making sure you remember it and can actually use it tomorrow.

### Languages

**What languages are supported?**

MVP supports: English,  Portuguese Portugal 
Later versions: Portuguese Brazil, French, German, Italian, Dutch. More languages coming.

**Can I learn multiple languages?**
Not now for the future.

### Technical

**Does it work offline?**

Reviews work offline. The app pre-generates sentences when you're connected. Adding new words requires connectivity for translation and audio.

**Is my data private?**

Your vocabulary stays on your device and syncs to your private account. We don't sell data or share your words with third parties. You can export your full dataset anytime as CSV or JSON (for later releases). 

### Pricing

**Is LLYLI free?**

Curated vocabulary sets relevant to your interests and the words you've been adding. Example: if you're adding food-related vocabulary, the app might suggest a "Restaurant Portuguese" pack. These are pre-validated high-frequency phrases for common situations. This is a future feature.

How much will the paid tier cost?
€3-5 per month or €40-60 per year. Pricing reflects actual infrastructure costs (LLM API, TTS, hosting) while staying accessible to students and expats.

**What are word packs?**

Curated vocabulary sets relevant to your interests and the words you've been adding. Example: if you're adding food-related vocabulary, the app might suggest a "Restaurant Portuguese" pack. This is a future feature.

### Future

**What's coming next?**

What's coming next?
Camera input (Q2 2026): Photograph a sign, menu, or document to capture words. OCR automatically extracts text.
Voice input (Q3 2026): Speak a word to capture it, especially useful for pronunciation practice and on-the-go capture.

Both features maintain the same core promise: frictionless capture, dynamic sentences, science-backed scheduling.

**Will there be a desktop version?**

Not in the immediate roadmap. Mobile is the priority because word capture happens in daily life, which is mobile-first.

**What about conversation practice or speaking exercises?**
LLYLI focuses specifically on the capture-to-mastery pipeline for vocabulary. We believe doing one thing exceptionally well (turning encountered words into permanent knowledge) is more valuable than building a mediocre all-in-one language app.
For conversation practice, we recommend language exchange partners, tutors, or apps specifically built for that purpose. Use LLYLI to ensure you remember the words you need for those conversations.
