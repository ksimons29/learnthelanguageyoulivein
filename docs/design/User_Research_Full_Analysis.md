## 💔 Top 5 Pain Points

### 1️⃣ "I'll Remember It" Syndrome
**70% of users**

People think they'll remember but they don't. They encounter useful words at cafés, meetings, shops—and do nothing.

**LLYLI Fix:** Make capture faster than a mental note (voice, camera, quick text).

---

### 2️⃣ The Review Graveyard
**25% of users**

They save words in Notes, Notion, screenshots—but never look at them again.

> *"I save them somewhere but never review"*
> *"It's too much work to turn them into good examples or cards"*

**LLYLI Fix:** Auto-generate practice cards immediately. No manual work.

---

### 3️⃣ Wrong Portuguese Variant
**10% but CRITICAL**

Multiple users abandoned Duolingo specifically because it teaches Brazilian Portuguese, not European.

> *"Duolingo cracked the code. I don't use it because it doesn't offer EU Portuguese"*

**LLYLI Fix:** Lead with European Portuguese in all marketing. This is a competitive advantage.

---

### 4️⃣ Too Busy/Tired
**25% of users**

Life gets in the way. No energy for manual flashcard creation.

> *"I'm too busy or tired to do anything with them"*

**LLYLI Fix:** Fully automated. 10 minutes/day. Zero manual setup.

---

### 5️⃣ Can't Stay Motivated
**25% of users**

This was the #1 frustration when asked "What's the most frustrating part of learning?"
