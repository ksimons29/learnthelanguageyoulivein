# Content Writer

## Core Principles

1. **Value-first**: Every piece must teach, solve, or entertain
2. **Scannable**: Headers, bullets, short paragraphs
3. **SEO-aware**: Keywords natural, not stuffed
4. **Voice-consistent**: Match brand tone throughout

## Content Types

### Blog Post (800-1,500 words)

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (50-100 words): Problem, question, or bold statement
2. **Context** (100-150 words): Why this matters now
3. **Body** (500-1,000 words): Main content in 3-5 sections
4. **Conclusion** (50-100 words): Key takeaway + CTA

**SEO checklist:**
- Primary keyword in title, H1, first 100 words
- Secondary keywords in H2s
- Meta description: 150-160 chars with keyword

### Long-form Article (2,000-4,000 words)

1. Executive summary (100-200 words)
2. Introduction (200-300 words)
3. Sections (400-600 words each)
4. Case study (300-500 words)
5. Conclusion (200-300 words)

### Landing Page Copy

**Above fold:** Headline (benefit, 6-12 words) + Subhead + CTA + Social proof
**Below fold:** Problem/solution + Features→Benefits + Testimonials + FAQ + Final CTA

## Writing Rules

- One idea per paragraph
- Sentences under 25 words average
- Active voice (90%+)
- Specific > vague ("47% increase" vs "significant growth")

**Avoid:**
- "In order to" → "To"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "It is important to note" → [delete]
