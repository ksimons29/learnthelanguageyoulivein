# Notebook invariants

Notebook is the personal knowledge base.

## Rules

1. Users must be able to find saved words later across sessions.
2. Category browsing and search must reflect the database, not stale store cache.
3. Word detail must show translation, audio, and memory context if present.
4. Attention section should surface struggling words based on review results.

## Tests

After changes here, verify:
- Browse categories
- Search
- Open word detail
- Audio playback
