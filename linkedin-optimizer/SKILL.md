# LinkedIn Optimizer

## Core Principles

1. **Recruiter-first thinking**: Optimize for how recruiters actually search
2. **Keyword density matters**: Front-load searchable terms in headline and summary
3. **Specificity wins**: "Senior Product Manager | AI/ML | B2B SaaS" beats "Experienced Professional"
4. **Show don't tell**: Quantified achievements over soft skills

## Profile Optimization

### Headline Formula (120 chars max)

```
[Current Role] | [Specialty/Niche] | [Industry/Domain] | [Value Prop]
```

**Generate 3 variations:**
1. Role-focused: Emphasizes title and seniority
2. Skill-focused: Leads with expertise areas
3. Value-focused: Leads with what you deliver

### Summary/About Section (2,600 chars max)

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (1-2 lines): What you do + unique angle
2. **Proof** (3-4 lines): Key achievements with numbers
3. **Expertise** (2-3 lines): Core skills and domains
4. **Current focus** (1-2 lines): What you're looking for
5. **CTA** (1 line): How to reach you

**Rules:**
- First person, conversational but professional
- Front-load keywords in first 300 chars
- No buzzwords: "passionate", "driven", "guru", "ninja"

### Experience Section Bullet Formula

```
[Action verb] + [what you built/led] + [scope/scale] + [measurable outcome]
```

### Skills Section Strategy

1. List 50 skills (LinkedIn max)
2. Top 3 pinned = most searched terms for target roles
3. Include both broad ("Product Management") and specific ("A/B Testing")
4. Add tool names ("Amplitude", "Mixpanel", "Jira")

## Content Creation

### Post Formulas

**Hook + Story + Lesson**
```
[Provocative statement or question]

[3-5 line story with specific details]

[Key takeaway]

[Question to drive comments]
```

**List Post**
```
[Topic]: [Number] things I learned

1. [Point] - [explanation]
2. [Point] - [explanation]

Which resonates most?
```

### Post Optimization

- **Length**: 1,200-1,500 chars optimal
- **First line**: Must hook (shows in feed preview)
- **Line breaks**: Every 1-2 sentences
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 max, at end
- **Best times**: Tue-Thu, 7-8am or 5-6pm

## Keyword Research

1. Pull 5-10 job descriptions for target role
2. Extract repeated terms (skills, tools, responsibilities)
3. Prioritize terms in 70%+ of JDs

**Placement Priority:**
1. Headline: Top 3-4 keywords
2. About first 300 chars: Top 5 keywords
3. Experience bullets: Tool/skill keywords
4. Skills section: All extracted keywords

## Deliverables Format

```
## Headline Options
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]
3. [Option 3]

## About Section
[Full optimized text]

## Experience Rewrites
[Company - Role]
- [Bullet 1]
- [Bullet 2]

## Skills to Add/Reorder
Top 3 to pin: [skill], [skill], [skill]
```
